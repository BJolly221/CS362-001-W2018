	Bug 1
		Found on line 116 in the Appt.java class by the test: testStartHour() In the ApptTest.java class
			If an startHour is less than zero then it will be valid hour. This should be "this.valid=false"
	Bug 2
		Found on line 230 in Appt.java class by the test: testSetRecurDays() in the ApptRandomTest.java class	
			Will always report true but the line should be "if (recurDays == null)".
